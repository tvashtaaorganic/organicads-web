    question: "How to Calculate My Monthly Profit?",
    answer:
      "Calculating your monthly profit is simple. Start by dividing your monthly SEO marketing budget by the average lifetime profit from a customer. This gives you an estimate of the return on investment (ROI) from your SEO efforts. At OrganicAds, we can help you track this metric effectively, ensuring your SEO campaigns bring measurable results and long-term profits.",

    question: "When Can You Expect SEO Results?",

After outsourcing SEO to a trusted expert like OrganicAds, you should expect to see noticeable improvements within 4 days to 6 months to 12 months. SEO requires consistent effort and a strategic approach to generate organic traffic and achieve top rankings. By being patient and persistent, you can expect a significant return on your investment after 12 months of SEO optimization.",

By tracking your revenue and marketing spend, you can gauge the return on investment (ROI) and optimize your strategies for maximum profitability over time.",
