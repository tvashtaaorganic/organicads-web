    question: "What is SEO Outsourcing?",
    answer:
      "SEO outsourcing refers to the practice of hiring a third-party agency or expert to handle SEO tasks such as on-page and off-page optimization, rather than managing these activities with an in-house team. This approach helps businesses leverage specialized skills, reduce costs, and focus on core operations while improving their online presence.",

  {
    question: "What is White Label SEO?",
    answer:
      "White Label SEO is the process of outsourcing SEO services to a third-party agency, which performs the SEO work behind the scenes while you present it under your own brand. This allows businesses to offer SEO services to their clients without directly handling the tasks, providing a seamless service under their own name.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Difference Between Normal SEO and White Label SEO?",
    answer:

In contrast, White Label SEO means partnering with an external agency like OrganicAds to handle SEO for your clients under your brand. This approach allows businesses to reduce costs by avoiding the need to hire an in-house SEO team while benefiting from the agencys expertise and experience in delivering high-quality SEO services.",
