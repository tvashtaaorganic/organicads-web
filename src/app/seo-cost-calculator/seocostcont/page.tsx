        <p className="mb-3 text-justify">
        Determining the right amount to allocate for SEO depends on your business needs and goals. There isnot a one-size-fits-all answer, as every business has unique requirements. A useful approach is to continue investing in SEO until you see a significant return on investment (ROI). To get a clearer picture, calculate your cost per acquisition (CPA) and customer lifetime value (CLV). By understanding these metrics, you can evaluate how much value you are gaining from SEO efforts. At OrganicAds, we recommend using these figures to create a tailored SEO budget that drives the best results for your business.
